If you're looking for something interesting, just move along. You're not in the right place

The only interesting thing is that this was the first project I did exclusively in vim which is why it took me an excrutiatingly long time to get it done 


This is only on github for version control purposes and because I can't put it in a private repo cuz
I can't get github student using my CC email for some reason ayoo _killme_
